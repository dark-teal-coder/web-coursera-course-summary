            <li>WHY do you want to invest in the first place?</li>
            <li>Selecting an investment strategy largely depends on your financial goals.</li>
            <li>Examples of financial goals:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>building an emergency fund</li>
                    <li>investing for retirement</li>
                    <li>saving for a home down payment</li>
                    <li>starting a business or family</li>
                </ul>
        </ul>
        <h4>Video: Stock Basics</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>A stock is a portion of ownership of a company.</li>
            <li>Stocks are also known as shares of a company, or equity investments, and are primarily bought and sold on publicly traded stock exchanges.</li>
            <li>There are 2 common ways that you can earn money through stock ownership.</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Value/Capital appreciation</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>They're worth more when the business overall value increases and may also command higher market prices due to demand.</li>
                            <li>That means you can earn money by selling your stock at a profit.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Dividend payments</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Stockholders might earn dividends of a company's profit, which may be paid in cash or in additional stock.</li>
                        </ul>
                </ol>
            <li>Stock market: The stock market is where investors connect to buy and sell investments.</li>
            <li>A stock is a share of ownership of a company which you can purchase electronically.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Video: Understanding Stocks</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Each share of stock represents a small but equal share in the company.</li>
            <li>The stocks you can buy are in public companies that have registered their stock with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</li>
            <li>A diversified portfolio will help to mitigate the risk of being too heavily invested in any one category.</li>
            <li>Stocks are sometimes referred to as equities.</li>
            <li>Owners of stocks are often referred to as stockholders or shareholders.</li>
            <li>Stocks come in 2 varieties</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Common stocks: Along with proportional ownership of the company and the growth potential, common stocks also offer voting rights to the stockholder (e.g., management elections or structural business changes).</li>
                    <li>Preferred stocks don't come with voting rights, but they're getting preferred status in the earnings that are paid out to preferred stockholders first.</li>
                </ol>
            <li>Market capitalization: the market value of a company's publicly traded stock.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Larger companies/cap stocks: older, more established, and less risky for investors</li>
                    <li>Smaller companies/cap stocks: often newer, less established, riskier, and more growth potential</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Stocks classified in different style categories:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Value stocks: stocks considered to be under value</li>
                    <li>Growth stocks: companies expected to continue growing at a faster rate than their competitors</li>
                    <li>Dividend investing: a style utilized by investors targeting stocks' ability to produce income or yield high dividends and provide cash flow (e.g., utility and real estate companies)</li>
                </ul>
        </ul>
        <h4>Video: Analyzing Stocks</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The value of stock is made up of several factors:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>the company's ability to continue making a profit</li>
                    <li>its customer base</li>
                    <li>its financial structure</li>
                    <li>the economy</li>
                    <li>political and cultural trends</li>
                    <li>how the company fits within a broader industry</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Ratios can also offer insight into a company's financial health, allowing for comparisons to other companies in the same industry or against the overall market.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Price to earning ratio (P ratio):</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It divides the market price of a company's stock by the company's earning per share.</li>
                            <li>It can reveal how many years it'll take for a company to generate enough value to buy back its stock.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Price to sales ratio:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It divides the market capitalization of the company by its revenue.</li>
                            <li>It should be as close to one as possible. If it's less than one, it's considered excellent.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Earnings per share (EPS)</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It is calculated by taking the net income, subtracting any preferred stock dividends, and dividing the result by the total number of outstanding common stock shares.</li>
                            <li>It lets you know how much earnings each shareholder would receive if the company was liquidated immediately.</li>
                            <li>Rising EPS means the company's potential to more money to distribute to shareholders or roll back into the business.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Return on equity (ROE)</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It is determined by dividing the company's net income by the shareholder's equity, then multiplying it by 100.</li>
                            <li>It measures the growth and profit of a company.</li>
                            <li>It tells you the value you receive as a shareholder should the company liquidate.</li>
                        </ul>
                </ul>
        </ul>
        <h4>Video: Investing in Stocks</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Stocks might lose value under a few circumstances.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The issuing company falters or goes under.</li>
                    <li>If the market as a whole experience losses due to wider-reaching occurrences like economic recessions, war, or political changes.</li>
                    <li>Scary news and headlines</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Stocks are volatile and their value can fluctuate in wide swings, but the expectation is that they will still trend upwards over time.</li>
            <li>In order to reduce risk, keep portfolio diversification with stocks across a range of sectors and risks.</li>

        <h3>01.02 Understanding Bonds</h3>
        <h4>Video: Bond Basics</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Bonds are loans you make to either a company or a government entity for a fixed period of time.</li>
            <li>They pay you fixed interests until they pay you the money back in the future.</li>
            <li>Three common types of bonds:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Treasury bonds, which are issued by the US Government (less risky)</li>
                    <li>Corporate bonds, which are issued by corporations (higher returns)</li>
                    <li>Municipal bonds, which are issued by a state or local government agency, e.g., airports, school districts, and sewer and water authorities</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Two key benefits of purchasing bonds:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Reliable source of income</li>
                    <li>Lower risks used to reduce volatility of a portfolio</li>
                </ul>
            <li>You can also access bonds through bond mutual funds or even bond ETFs.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Video: Understanding Bonds</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Corporate bonds are rated for risk by agencies such as Standard and Poor and Moody's.</li>
            <li>The precise scale varies with the rating agency.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Bonds rated AAA to BBB by S&P are considered investment grade.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>As a rule, investors demand higher interest on lower quality bonds. High-yield bonds yield more because the risk of default is higher.</li>
            <li>Yield is the income generated on a given investment over a set period of time.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Expressed as a percentage in annual terms</li>
                    <li>The interest paid on that bond typically stated on the bond itself</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Yield to maturity calculates the average return for the bond when it matures based on the purchase price.</li>
            <li>If the interest rates on the bond (also the coupon rate) are higher than that on bonds issued today, the bond value will be at a premium or higher than par value.</li>
            <li>If the rate on the bond is lower than that on newly issued bonds, the bond will trade at a discount or lower than the price of the par value.</li>
            <li>The primary way to make money on bonds is by receiving interest while owning the bond.</li>
            <li>Another way that you can make money on a bond is by buying it at a discount and holding it to maturity.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Video: Analyzing Bonds</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>An issuer is the entity that borrowed the money.</li>
            <li>Maturity is how long the bondholders have to wait for their money.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The longer, the higher the interest rate, but also the greater the risk</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Quality is the financial strength of the issuer.</li>
            <li>Prices and interest rates tend to go in different directions.</li>
            <li>If you are trying to sell your bond before it matures:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Higher interest rates result in lower bond prices.</li>
                    <li>Lower interest rates result in higher bond prices.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Bonds:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Lower risk</li>
                    <li>Reduced price volatility</li>
                    <li>More predictable yield</li>

        <h4>Reading: Understanding The Yield to Maturity Formula</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Article: <a href="https://www.sofi.com/learn/content/yield-to-maturity-formula/">Guide to Yield to Maturity (YTM)</a></li>
            <li>Yield to Maturity (YTM) represents the total return expected from holding a bond until it matures, factoring in interest payments and principal repayment.</li>
            <li>Calculating YTM involves the bond’s coupon rate, face value, current market price, and time to maturity, making it a complex formula.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Coupon rate (or bond's interest rate): the regular payment issuers pay bondholders for the right to borrow their money</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The higher the coupon rate, the higher the yield.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Face value (or par value): the amount paid to a bondholder at its maturity date</li>
                    <li>Market price: how much an investor would have to pay for a bond on the open market currently</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The price buyers pay on the secondary market may be higher or lower than a bond’s face value. The higher the price of the bond, the lower the yield.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Maturity date: the date when the issuer repays the principal is known as the maturity date</li>
                </ul>
            <li>YTM is useful for comparing bonds with different characteristics, helping investors anticipate returns and understand interest rate risks associated with bond investments.</li>
            <li>Limitations of YTM include assumptions about reinvestment of interest payments and the neglect of taxes, which can significantly affect actual returns.</li>
            <li>Investors can utilize YTM as a tool for decision-making but should consider diversifying their portfolios and possibly consulting financial professionals for guidance.</li>
            <li>Yield to Maturity (YTM) Formula:<span class="math display">\[YTM=\frac{C + (FV - PV) \div t}{(FV + PV) \div 2}\]</span></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>C = Interest or coupon payment</li>
                    <li>FV = Face value of the investment</li>
                    <li>PV = Present value or current price of the investment</li>
                    <li>t = Years it takes the investment to reach the full value or maturity</li>
                </ul>

            <li>When trading options, investors can either buy existing contracts, or they can “write” or sell contracts for securities they currently hold.</li>
            <li>10 Options Trading Strategies:</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Long Calls (beginner)</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>e.g., Let’s say an investor believes that stock A will rise in one month. Stock A is currently trading at $10 a share and the investor believes it will rise above $12. The investor could buy an option with a $12 strike price and with an expiration date at least one month from now. If stock A’s price rises to hit $12 within a month, the value or “premium” of the option would likely rise.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Long Puts (beginner)</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>e.g., An investor who buys shares of Tech Stock C currently trading at $20 is nervous about the stock falling, so they buy puts with a strike price of $18 and an expiration two months from now.
                                <br>A month later, Tech Stock C stock tumbles to $15, and the investor needs to sell their shares for extra cash. The investor was able to sell the shares at $18 by exercising their puts.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Covered Calls (beginner)</li>

            <li>Employee stock options (ESO) give an employee the chance to purchase a set number of shares in the company at a set price — often called the exercise price — over a set amount of time.</li>
            <li>This gives an employee the chance to exercise their ESOs at a point when the exercise price is lower than the market price.</li>
            <li>Employee Stock Option Basics</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Exercise price/grant price/strike price: This is the given set price at which employees can purchase the stock options.</li>
                    <li>Market price: This is the current price of the stock on the market (which may be lower or higher than the exercise price).</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Typically an employee would only choose to exercise and purchase the options if the market price is higher than the grant price.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Issue date: This is the date on which you’re given the options.</li>
                    <li>Vesting date: This is the date after which you can exercise your options per the original terms or vesting schedule.</li>
                    <li>Exercise date: This is the date you actually choose to exercise your options.</li>
                    <li>Expiration date: This is the date on which your ability to exercise your options expires.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Reason companies offer stock options:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>If employees are financially invested in the success of the company, then they’re more likely to be emotionally invested in its success as well, and it can increase employee productivity.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>2 main kinds of employee stock options, each of which has different tax implications:</li>
